# PageRank_simple
This PageRank program was written for a graduate course in Realtime and Big Data. It is meant to test basic input with a known format that consists of characters and doubles, specifically:
<ul>
<li>A C F 0.166667</li>
B D E F 0.166667
C A B 0.166667
D A B C E F 0.166667
E F 0.166667
F B C 0.166667
The output is the result of a single iteration, formatted the same as the input.
